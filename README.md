# Wordle-Helper
This is a small program that can help people with Wordles. It takes some information from the user and displays all the words that the Wordle could be.
If the user does not get the right word, they will be given an option to re-run the program until they guess the word. 

This project does not use any libraries so it will run on all devices no problem! Just make sure to download the python script and the .txt file with all the words.
